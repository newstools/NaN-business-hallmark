Men of the Oyo State Security Network Agency popularly called Amotekun and some Fulani have reportedly engaged in a clash at Aiyete in the Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state. PUNCH reports that the clash was said to have started at Okebi village on Saturday morning but the cause of the clash could not be immediately ascertained at the time of filing this report. A man, Saliu, who claimed to be a resident of the area told PUNCH that seven persons had been killed. He added that about seven houses were also razed. Saliu said, “Alhaji Usman Okebi and his two sons were killed. We don’t know what caused the fight. Some persons were shot and injured. “The number of people killed has increased to seven. Those who were shot and ran away later died in the bush.” Another source said the clash was between the Amotekun corps and Bororo people.
