 The CEO of Asher Kings and Queens Restaurant in Kaduna State, Aisha Yakubu, has said she was not the owner of the facility demolished by the Kaduna State government over alleged plans to host a sex party. Yakubu who spoke on Monday on a PUNCH Online interview programme, The Roundtable, said she rented the building for her business at the rate of N500,000 per annum. “I have a landlord. I am not the owner of the building. I was the first occupant of the plot. It was just only me on the plot and I paid N500,000 for the rent,” PUNCH quoted her as saying. “The landlord was not informed before the demolition occurred. He called me during the demolition and asked if there was any notice and I told him there was none. “He (the landlord) knows me and he knows I can’t do something of such nature,” the restaurateur further said. Yakubu also told PUNCH that apart from losing her one-month pregnancy due to shock, she also lost cooking utensils, chillers, deep freezers, outdoor catering utensils, and cash, estimated to worth N32 million, as she was not allowed to salvage any of the items before the demolition was carried out. The restaurateur, who said life has not been the same since the demolition occurred, insisted that the facility was not a hotel as claimed by the police and the state government. ‌ Yakubu said she rented the facility out to a client, who paid N5,000 to showcase his clothing line. Recall that the Kaduna State Police Command last Wednesday said it made arrests in connection with the maiden edition of the Kaduna sex party. The party, which received high publicity on social media and slated for December 27, 2020 at an undisclosed venue, was, however, aborted. One of the party organisers paraded by the police had said the sex party was a joke
