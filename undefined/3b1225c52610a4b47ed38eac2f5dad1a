The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has refuted reports of resignation of the Divisional Police Officer of Itam Division, Francis Eharbor, a Chief Superintendent of Police over alleged non-promotion despite his impeccable records in the service. There had been reports on social media to the effect of that Eharbor said he had decided to to quit the after 30 years in the service due to alleged nepotism and unbridled corruption. But the state Police Command in a statement by its Public Relations Officer, Odiko MacDon, a Superintendent of Police, stated that the reported resignation was a ruse as appointment and resignation are never done in the social media but through administrative procedures. “The attention of the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has been drawn to a write up making the rounds, that the Divisional Police Officer ( DPO ), of ‘D’ Division, Itam, CSP Francis Osage Erhabor has resigned from the Nigeria Police Force on the grounds of lack of promotion,” the statement said. “For the avoidance of doubt, appointments and resignations of the NPF are not done on social media. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Amienghene Andrew, fdc, is not in receipt of any letter of resignation from the Senior Officer and has not in any way communicated same to the Force headquarters. “Let it be known, that the publication making the rounds is a figment of the imagination of the writer. “Hence, members of the public are to totally disregard the said publication as the senior officer is still a bonafide member of the NPF and still the DPO of Itam Divisional Police Station.”
