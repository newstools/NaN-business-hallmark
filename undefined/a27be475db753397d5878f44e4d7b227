Leading indigenous quick service restaurant (QSR) chain, Tantalizers, is welcoming pupils in nursery and primary schools to the new session with its special ‘Back to School’ packs The ‘Back to School’ pack which is being offered in all the 53 outlets of Tantalizers across the country include the Tantis Kids Meal with its accompanying kids’ drink, a beautiful water bottle, a 30g Minimie chin-chin and a 500ml PET drink for only N1,000. The Deputy Managing Director of Tantalizers Plc, Gbolahan Labinjo, who revealed that Tantalizers has partnered with Minimie and 7-Up to include a 30g pack size of the chin-chin and PET Pepsi and Mountain Dew in the Tantalizers ‘Back to School’ pack in the next one year, said that the promo is to make the new season an enjoyable one for the pupils and the offering very affordable for many families. Labinjo disclosed that many schools have already signed on to be part of the programme as the pupils resume for the new session. It would be recalled that Tantalizers added Tantis Kids Meals to its offerings, mid 2014. This children-dedicated meal, which the makers tout as being “very delicious and nutritious”, comes in six variants to ensure wide variety of the meals among children. Another added value of the Tantis kids meal is that each comes with 200 to 250ml packed-sized drink at no extra cost to the parents. The attractive package features carton elements which the kids love.
