 Unknown to many of the guests and stakeholders of the Performing Musicians of Nigeria (PMAN) that were already seated for the formal launch of the its Biometric ID card, one of the partners of the noble gesture, Heritage Bank, almost pulled out at the last minute. Downstairs shortly before the event commenced, a female representative from the bank raised an alarm following a letter she said was sent to them by two dissenting members of the association, Messrs Orits Williki and Kevin Luciano who belong to another faction. Sounding uncontrollable as the PMAN boss, Pretty Okafor, his lieutenants and others tried to explain the true position of things to her, the lady later relaxed when she saw documents of authenticity, especially the court ruling that empowered the new executive to take total control. And it was the needed elixir to calm her frayed nerves.  She finally joined the party but sat quietly throughout the duration of the event which took place at  Planet One, Maryland Ikeja. Despite all the initiatives to unite members of the body as one indivisible family, there seems not to be any end in sight to the silent war raging between them.
