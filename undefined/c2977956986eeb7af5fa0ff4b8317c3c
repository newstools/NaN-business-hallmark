OBINNA EZUGWU The Lagos State Government has announced that all public and private schools below the tertiary level in Lagos State should resume for the second term 2020/21 academic session from Monday, 18th of January, 2021. The Honourable Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, who announced the decision on Monday, stated that the directive is in line with the Federal Government’s position to curtail the spread of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. She enjoined all schools to comply with all the outlined COVID-19 requirements for resumption, saying that “The directive is not only for the improvement of the overall school operations but for the safe reopening of academic activities to support the Lagos State Government’s quest for a full return”. The Commissioner advised all schools to have flexible plans where students and teachers who feel sick can teach or learn from home via available online platforms, adding that schools should also strive to prevent any COVID-19 infection among all students and staff. Mrs. Adefisayo, therefore, enjoined teachers, students and visitors to wear facemasks at all times, observe physical distancing, embrace regular handwashing with soap under running water and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene within the school premises.
